Internship Overview:
Location: Remote (Meta Scifor Technologies, Bangalore, India)
Stipends: Performance-Based
Mode: Remote
Duration: 6 months
Immediate Opening: Yes
Preferred Candidates: Freshers, Pre-Final Year Graduates,  Final Year Graduates, Recent Graduates

Job Description: Intern Program Overview:
Meta Scifor Technologies is excited to offer positions in our Intern program, a comprehensive 6-month training and internship initiative. This program is designed to provide aspiring Developers with a strong foundation and hands-on experience.

Program Structure:
Training Phase (3 Months):
The initial three months are dedicated to intensive training, conducted five days a week (Monday to Friday). Our training sessions are led by seasoned professionals with over five years of experience. The structured curriculum focuses on imparting essential, production-level skills. Successful completion of this phase results in a training certificate from  Meta Scifor Technologies Pvt. Ltd.

Internship Phase (3 Months):
Following the training, participants transition to a three-month internship as  Interns of the company. During this period, interns work on real projects under the guidance of a mentor, integrating with our teams and contributing to ongoing work. Given our current project demands, there is a high likelihood of interns being actively involved in significant tasks. A stipend upto 12,000 Rs will be provided during this phase. This phase continues to be completely remote.
 
Professional Growth:
Upon completing the internship, participants will receive a professional experience certificate, acknowledging their contributions and the skills acquired over the six months. We place a strong emphasis on daily performance evaluations, and outstanding interns will be considered for permanent full time fresher positions. The starting salary for this role is up to 22,000 Rs per month, with potential increments and a 10% hike every six months. The role is designed to be hybrid, offering the flexibility of working remotely or on-site.

Transition to Permanent Roles:
Post-training, the transition to the full time fresher roles depends on the interns' performance. We conduct daily evaluations, and those who excel in their assessments are likely to be offered permanent positions. Given our current project backlog, there's a significant opportunity for interns to move into permanent roles based on their performance during the internship.

Remote Work Model:
At present, offline training is not feasible due to our commitment to ongoing projects and full capacity utilization of our workspace. This has led us to adopt a work-from-home model, which aligns with our approach towards enhancing employee satisfaction and efficiency.

Selection Process Overview:
Our selection process comprises three rigorous rounds: resume shortlisting, an MCQ round, and a technical round—each meticulously designed to identify individuals who exhibit enthusiasm for learning and a dedication to excellence. We commend your successful navigation of these rounds thus far and look forward to potentially welcoming you into our esteemed program.

About Company:-

Meta Scifor Technologies is committed to pioneering technological advancements. We foster a work environment that promotes growth and innovation, offering an ideal platform for skill enhancement and significant project contributions.
